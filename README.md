#### THIS LIB NOT YET VIABLE FOR PRODUCTION

Thank you for your time, this lib is a basic file server
that uses macaroons as authentication.  Neither the macaroons crate, 
nor the implementation within has been vetted by security analysts and
as such must be considered broken.  Do not use this if life, limb, or
peace of mind are a concern to you.

You have been warned.

#### OTHERWISE, WELCOME!

Enclosed you will find the bare essentials for creating a macaroon based api.
I'm not sure if this works right but as my long time friend and source of inspiration 
Ms. Frizzle says "Turn Coffee into Code, and make great Mistakes!"
